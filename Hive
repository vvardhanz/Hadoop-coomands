- Hive was created to make it possible for analysts with strong SQL skills (but meager JAVA skills ) to run queries on huge volume of data that is stored in HDFS.
- Hive runs on your workstation  and converts your SQL queries into a series of jobs for execution on a Hadoop cluster.
- Hive organizes data into tables, which provides a means for attaching structure to data stored in HDFS.
- Hive is a successful  Apache Java Project used by many organizations as a general purpose project, scalable data processing unit.
- Metadata - such as table schemas - is stored in a database called the Metastore.
- The database stores its files in a directory called metastore_db, which is relative to the location from which you ran the hive command.
-  It is the ability to execute SQL data against the raw data that gives the HIVE its power.
